    <h2>Questions</h2>
        <h3>What do you want to achieve with the visualization?</h3>
        <p>What are the political themes du jour? What are the most important political topics of any given year? In its 21 seasons, South Park has become one of the cornerstones of American political satire. In the almost 30 years it has run, it has satirized all of the most pressing political issues relevant today: immigration, abortion, LGBTQ+ rights, terrorism, and more. I want users to be able to explore the trends in political themes throughout the history of South Park. By having this data in a time-series, we will be able to track the trends of these themes across the years and hopefully be able to see spikes of certain themes that relate to real world events (terrorism spiking in 2001-2002, for example).</p>
        <h3>What tasks do you want to support?</h3>
        <p>This interactive visualization will support humanities researchers in departments like Political Science, American Culture Studies, or Sociology. Political satire is an important way to understand the cultural and political zeitgeist of any given period and data stories like these will be important for understanding our current political moment. 
        </p>
        <h3>What designs will help you accomplish these?</h3>
        <p> I am curious about using a ThemeRiver (or StreamGraph) – because I am tracking themes over time, I think this is a good candidate for the design. It is a close relative of the histogram and so I will be able to use totals of the times that each theme is mentioned in the episodes to achieve this. My other option would be to do a stacked area chart or multiple line charts - the benefit of this approach is that we could see the peaks more clearly for each theme. In either direction I go, the visualization will allow the user to pick which themes are displayed and be shown tooltips of important contextual events (9/11, Obamacare’s passage, etc.). Users will also be able to scrub through the timeline to see the trends for a more specific time period.</p>
