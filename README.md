# South Park Political Themes Interactive Visualization

This interactive data visualization explores the evolution of political discourse in Comedy Central's South Park across 21 seasons (1997-2017), tracking 24 political themes organized into four categories: Domestic Policy, Foreign/Security, Economic, and Social/Cultural. The streamgraph visualization reveals how political satire trends have shifted over time, with spikes corresponding to real-world events like 9/11, the Iraq War, and the 2016 election. Open `index.html` to explore the interactive visualization, or view `processbook.html` for the design process and justification.
